Problem Statement
Given a string s consisting of lowercase letters, find the first repeated character in the string. A character is considered repeated if it appears more than once, and among all such characters, the one whose second occurrence has the smallest index should be returned.

Input Format
A single string s.

Output Format
Print the first repeated character. If no character is repeated, print -1.
